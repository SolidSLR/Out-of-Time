# Out-of-Time
First LDJam

Hi there! Thank you for checking my game!

This little thing will test your will to keep moving, even when everything seems to go against you.

You may find the game controls on the first screen of the game.

This game was created with Unity and C#, and the sound effects was done with Bosca Ceoil (https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/bosca-ceoil).

Once again, thanks for your time! :)
